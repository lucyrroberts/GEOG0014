Your groupâ€™s report must contain the following elements: Title Hypothesis Location Briefly describe where you undertook the research and the rationale behind the site selection. Results The raw data you collect should be in your individual field notebooks but briefly summarise your results. Use Graphs and Tables as appropriate. Interpretation Describe how you have used your data to determine whether they support your hypothesis. Conclusions Summarise your key findings as 1 or 2 bullet points. Reflection What worked well or badly? If you were doing it again, what would you change? Were there other unforeseen factors that influenced your results? References Include any references that you have used In your report, you must also address the following questions: Which t-test did you undertake and why? What, if any, assumptions have you made about your data?
